## Problem 1

Compute a derivative of the following function:

- $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5$
- $x(t) = t^2 + 3t - 5$

What is a difference between these two derivatives?

## Problem 2

Compute an integral of the following function:

- $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5$
- $x(t) = t^2 + 3t - 5$

What is a difference between these two integrals?


## Problem 3

Plot the following parametric function:

\begin{align*}
 x(t) &= 3t \\
 y(t) &= t^2 - 3t 
\end{align*} 

What is the shape of the plot? What describes the parametric function?
Can you tell what kind of physical process is described by the function?
