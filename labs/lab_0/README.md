# Introduction

The classes will cover the discussion of the lecture conditions and the method of conducting exercises. 
These laboratories will take place for most groups before the first lecture, so we will focus on getting to 
know the tools that will be useful in the further part of the learning process.


# Tools you can use in all classes and at exams (!):

- WolframAlpha - https://www.wolframalpha.com/ (free version is enough)
- Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/ (free version is enough)
- ChatGPT - https://chat.openai.com/ (free version is enough)
- Gemini Google - https://gemini.google.com/app (free version is enough)

Please use these tools to help you understand the material and solve problems. 
Your task is to understand the material, not to memorize it. You should be able to solve problems, 
not just remember the solutions. Kinds of problems you can solve on pieces of paper are very limited.
Our goal is to prepare you for the real world, where you will have access to all the tools you need.
We will play around with these tools during the classes, to explore physics beyond traditional problems.
