    "\n",
    "A common perception of vectors is as arrows or directed line segments in space, often interpreted as collections of numbers where the\n",
    "quantity of these numbers corresponds to the dimension of the space. This view is prevalent in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering,\n",
    "where vectors are used to represent quantities such as forces, velocities, or displacements, each with a magnitude and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the definition of a vector is broad enough to encompass more abstract entities, such as functions,\n",
    "which can also form a vector space. In this context, a vector space can be seen as a collection of functions\n",
    "that can be added together or multiplied by numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this wide applicability, in this lesson, we will focus on the classical examples of vectors as collections of numbers.\n",
    "These are the types of vectors that are most familiar and directly applicable to a wide range of problems in science and engineering,\n",
    "providing a concrete foundation for understanding the broader concept of vector spaces and their operations."
